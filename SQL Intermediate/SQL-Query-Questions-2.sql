Rank Functions 
ROW_NUMBER - It assigns the sequential rank number to each unique record.
RANK - It assigns the rank number to each row in a partition. It skips the number for similar values.
DENSE_RANK - It assigns the rank number to each row in a partition. It does not skip the number for similar values.
NTILE(N) - It divides the number of rows as per specified partition and assigns unique value in the partition.
