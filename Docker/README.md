***Server***  
In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software (computer program) that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients".  
Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client.  
Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.  
  
***Virtual Machine***
Aâ€¯Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps.  
VMs allow a business to run an operating system that behaves like a completely separate computer in an app window on a desktop.  
VMs may be deployed to accommodate different levels of processing power needs, to run software that requires a different operating system, or to test applications in a safe, sandboxed environment.   

***Hyper Visor***
A hypervisor, also known as a **virtual machine monitor** or VMM, is software that creates and runs virtual machines (VMs).   
A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.  

***RDP***
The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is a protocol, or technical standard, for using a desktop computer remotely.

***VDI***
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure

***Container***
A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 

***Docker Image***
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.
